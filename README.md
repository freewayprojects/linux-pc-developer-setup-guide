linux-pc-developer-setup-guide
===============================

This guide will help software developers to set up a Linux based PC to be used as a workstation.

# Overview

OK, so there's a ton of different ways to set up a workstation - and all developer's needs will be different.  This guide is meant to describe various tools and configurations which will be of use to developers.  Developers are expected to mix and match the tools described in this guide and select the ones most useful to their requirements.

Each tool or configuration is described first in generic detail - and then more specific instructions are added for different distributions.

Please send through any patches etc to improve/correct the document - especially how to make the changes for different distributions.

# Prerequisites

The initial Linux PC installation should have been completed.  This could be any distribution or version of Linux - this guide is intended to be generic as well as having distribution/version specific code snippets.

The main points about the pc which should already have been set up are:

* Linux base operating system installed.
* BIOS clock set correctly and datetime set correct within a couple of minutes.

Basically, the developer should be able to login to the pc and to carry out tasks as the administrator.
