linux-pc-developer-setup-guide
===============================

This guide will help software developers to set up a Linux based PC to be used as a workstation.

## Overview

OK, so there's a ton of different ways to set up a workstation - and all developer's needs will be different.  This guide is meant to describe various tools and configurations which will be of use to developers.  Developers are expected to mix and match the tools described in this guide and select the ones most useful to their requirements.

Each tool or configuration is described first in generic detail - and then more specific instructions are added for different distributions.

Please send through any patches etc to improve/correct the document - especially how to make the changes for different distributions.
